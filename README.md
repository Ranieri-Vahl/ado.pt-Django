The Ado.pt site consists of a complete adoption system, where a user after registering and logging in to the site can request an adoption of the Pets of other users or publish his Pet to be adopted.
When an adoption is requested for a certain Pet, the animal's owner receives the adoption request in his/her account and decides if accept or reject it. After this process , the user who made the request receive in your registered email if the request was approved or rejected.
On the site, you can also see the status of your Pets, search for other Pets by city or breed of preference, remove Pets that have already been adopted or that you no longer want to make available on the site, among other functions.
